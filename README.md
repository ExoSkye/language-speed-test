# Test the time on many different languages
Had a small argument about the overhead in many languages, so I made this.
It runs all the languages under `time -v` to view statistics of the execution.

# Usage

make sure you have the runtimes/compilers for all included languages.

```
make
make run
```

`make clean` to clean up files.
